## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

By creating this project I was able to go through the basics of grid and apply it in the given project and was able to develop a responsive design.

### Continued development

I'm still not comfortable in using grid to design responsive design so moving ahead will be focusing on it.
